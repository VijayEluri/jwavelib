Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

This section is a copy of the FAQ content you can find on the JWaveLib trac
instance.

Supported features 
------------------ 

* What kind of Coronis modules have been fully tested using JWaveLib ? 

The following list of modules have been thoroughly tested and are active on production sites :

   1. WaveTherm Dallas - 1 sensor
   2. WaveFlow - 1 counter
   3. WaveTalk 25 mW and 500 mW
   4. Serial WavePort 25/500 mW 

* What is the list of all the supported Coronis modules ? 

   1. WaveTherm Dallas - 1 sensor
   2. WaveFlow - 1 counter
   3. WaveTank
   4. WaveTalk 25 mW and 500 mW
   5. Serial WavePort 25/500 mW 

* What if the modules I want to use is not already supported by the JWaveLib ? 

Our politic is to support all the Coronis modules. Thus if you plan to use a module that is not actually supported by the JWaveLib, contact the support and we will give you an estimated time to get full support on this module. Lots of modules just require a very small development to work with the current JWaveLib.

For example : you need to use a WaveFlow? with two counters (A and B). Dipole Consulting will provide you a JWaveLib version supporting this type of module within one month.

* Does JWaveLib support automatic network configuration (SDP) ? 

At the moment, JWaveLib does not support the SDP protocol. The feature is in the development process for milestone 2.0 if available in the Coronis modules. The SDP protocol is not already available into the Coronis modules.

Coronis products related questions
----------------------------------

* How can we know if the module supports extended datalogging ? 

This is not possible using the Wavenis protocol. If the module has a strange behaviour when asking for the extended datalogging measures, it does probably not support extended datalogging. Only the Coronis technical support can confirm it. Send an e-mail with the module id to technicalsupport@coronis.com to check that.
