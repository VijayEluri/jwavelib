Projet:			 WaveSniffer
Description: 	sources code for the WaveSniffer project

/!\ The java software Analyser and Analyser-plug are outdated, please use JWaveTool

[firmware]
- Contains firmware for the sniffer based on a atmega640
- The serial communication bandwidth (AKA baudrate) between sniffer and PC is 115200 baud
- data output shape:
    <DIR><DATA><TS> 

[bootloader]
- Contains a butterfly compatible bootloader for the atmel ATmega640
- used to update easily the frimware
 
[Test]
 - serial_test.py:
	 - It's a simple python script to test firmware.
	 - There are 3 ways to send frames to the sniffer:
	 	- random generated frames
	 	- from a file that contain frame (one frame per line)
	 	- user generated frame
	- If it's used to read, frame are displayed in HEX format
	- This script can be used as a base for a better test protocol

[JWaveTool]
- Contains a modular tool or helping Wavenis integrator
- Current Modules:
    - waveSniffer: a module to use with the waveSnifer hardware (monitoring wavenis protocol)
- requirement:
	- RXTX (only for wavesniffer module)
	- log4j
	- latest svn vrsion of JWaveLib
	- JUnit (optional)

- The core folder contains the main software with the analyser
- The module folder contains all modules

Outdated information or software
===========================================================================

[Analyser]
- Contains the analyser for frame outputed by the sniffer.
- this is the non-modular version
- cli arguments:
	- first argument: USER INTERFACE : 'cli', 'gui', 'gen'
		- 'cli' launch the command line interface.
		- 'gui' launch the graphical interface.
		- 'gen' launch a very basic sniffer frame generator. ONLY for testing purpose.
	- second argument: SERIAL PORT (defaulted to /dev/ttyS0)

- requirement:
		- lib java RXTX for serial communication
		- jUnit for unit testing
		- The SVN version of JWavelib
		
[Analyser-plug]
- Contains the modular version of the analyser software
- need the latest svn version of JWavelib
- until now, CLI is broken so it's disabled

[Analyser-modules]
- Contains all the modules for Analyser-plug
- depends of:
    - latest version of Analyser-plug
    - latest svn version of JWavelib
    - Latest version of RXTX (only for analyser module)
    - Log4J 1.2
    - JUnit 3 (optional)
